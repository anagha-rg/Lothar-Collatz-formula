# Lothar-Collatz-formula
In 1937, a German mathematician named Lothar Collatz formulated an intriguing hypothesis (it still remains unproven) which can be described in the following way:      take any non-negative and non-zero integer number and name it c0;     if it's even, evaluate a new c0 as c0 ÷ 2;     otherwise, if it's odd, evaluate a new c0 as 3 × c0 + 1;     if c0 ≠ 1, skip to point 2.  The hypothesis says that regardless of the initial value of c0, it will always go to 1.
